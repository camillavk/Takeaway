I am going to write a program to manage a takeaway food business delivery. It will have the following functionality:
  
  list of dishes with prices

  Customer can place an order
		-	by choosing from a list of dishes,
		- selecting their chosen quantities
		- displaying a number that should be the exact total.

	If the sum is not correct the method should raise an error

	Otherwise the customer is sent a text saying that the order was placed successfully and that it will be delivered 1 hour from now, e.g. "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52‚Äù.

  The text sending functionality will be implemented using Twilio API.
